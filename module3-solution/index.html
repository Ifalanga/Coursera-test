                    An egg is formed over a period of about 25 hours. The egg yolks are formed in the hen's ovary. Hens, unlike most animals, have only one functional ovary, the left one. At the time of hatch, each female chick will have up to 4 000 tiny ova, from some of which yolks may develop when the hen matures. At any given time, an active layer will have a number of yolks in her ovary, in different stages of development. (See pic in this thread for an example of what is in store in a productive hen's tract at any given time:

                    It takes around 10 days for an egg yolk to mature, after which it gets released into the funnel (infundibulum) where, if live sperm are present, it will be fertilized. This process takes about 15 minutes. Next, the yolk moves down into the magnum, where inner and outer shell membranes are added, as well as water and mineral salts. This process takes about 3 hours. The yolk then moves into the isthmus, where albumen (egg white) is secreted and layered around the yolk. This process takes about an hour.

                    Next, the partly formed egg moves into the uterus, or shell gland, where it will receive its shell. Initially, some water is added, thinning the outer layer of albumen. Then the shell material, mostly calcium carbonate, is added, followed by pigments if a colored egg is produced. For example a brown, blue, or green egg. This process takes about 21 hours. Once this process is complete, the egg passes through the vagina and is laid by the hen. This final process takes less than a minute.
